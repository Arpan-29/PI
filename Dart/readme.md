#### Concept used here is - 

Circle inscribed in a square with side 'a' has area = **pi * (a * a) / 4**.   

Randomly points are chosen on the square, probability of point lying on the circle is **(Area of Circle / Area of Square)** which is equal to **pi / 4**. So, by multiplying that probability by **4** we can get the value of **pi**.
